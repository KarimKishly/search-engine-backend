# Epic People Search ðŸ”¥ Backend

## Introduction
This repository contains the backend code for the Epic People Search ðŸ”¥
Engine. The code is developed in python using FastAPI and is hosted on a 
uvicorn server on the default port 8000.

## How to run
After cloning the repository to PyCharm, install the dependencies in the 
`requirements.txt` file to the PyCharm virtual environment. Running `search-engine.bat`
in the terminal will call the virtual environment and run the server.

Elasticsearch should be running locally in order for the backend to function properly.
The Elasticsearch credentials are present in the code and are not currently configurable.
